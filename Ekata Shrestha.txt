Hello! My name is Ekata Shrestha. 
I am from Hetauda, Makawanpur. 
And currently studying in Hetauda School of management in 8th sem of BIM department.

My learning journey within 3 days was great. 
In the beginning, it was abit tough for me to understand those codes, because for me this topic was completely new.
But as the time passed, i was able to learn many new things from my instructor.
Now, I am practing all the things that my instructor had taught me. 
So, it's being alittle easy for me.

This session was beyond my expectation. This session helped me to gain the core ideas of git and github.
And I think that I will be able to solve the problem related to this course.

At last, All thanks to Genese Cloud Academy for giving this opportunity to learn Git and Github, 
And to our instructor Mr. Milan Thapa sir for teaching and guiding us through out the session effectively.

Thank You!!
